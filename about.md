# About this repo

This repository contains the content and config files for my [portfolio page](https://robichaudc.github.io/portfolio/)

## How it works
The Portfolio site is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/)

- README.md contains the page content
- _config.yml adds a custom [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/)
