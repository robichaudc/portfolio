## Welcome!

My name is Chris Robichaud and I am a software engineer / full-stack developer, currently focused on android development. I'm interested in hacking / making / DIY projects, civil liberties and technology.

In the future I plan to add sample projects, demos and articles here. 

## Projects

### Resume / CV
- [Link](https://registry.jsonresume.org/robichaudc)
- [Repo](https://gitlab.com/crobicha/portfolio)

I was looking for a way to automate the process of keeping my CV up-to-date. After researching a few tools, I decided that the [JSON Resume project](https://jsonresume.org/) seemed like the best choice. It has a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-resume-exporter/caobgmmcpklomkcckaenhjlokpmfbdec) that will pull your data from [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/crobicha/) and format into a [JSON file](https://gitlab.com/crobicha/portfolio/-/blob/master/data/resume.json), which you can then use a command-line utility to format into one of [many different themes](https://jsonresume.org/themes/). 

I wrote [a small script](https://gitlab.com/crobicha/portfolio/-/blob/master/setup.sh) that would automate the process of generating my json content in several different themes, so that I could play around with the final display a bit and try out different things. It can also be configured to generate PDF files in each theme
